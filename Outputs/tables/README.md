Multiply imputed data for (0/1 for invasive/non invasive) for those who died within 3 days of peak troponin and who didn’t have invasive management.

Variables adjusted for were determined from the previous script – 6_multivariable_model_propen_adjustment       |
|     9     |     table3_multiinvas_noninvas_25_75      |     8_multivariable_all_invasive_noninvasive    |     Combination of 3 models:   1. Death in 3 days of peak troponin all assigned as non-invasive  2. Death in 3 days of peak troponin all assigned as invasive 3. Model including patients whose propensity scores were between the 25th and 75th percentiles only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|     10    |     table3_multi_25_75_removal_vars       |     8_multivariable_all_invasive_noninvasive    |     Model including patients whose propensity scores were between the 25th and 75th percentiles only – removing problematic variables where there are 0 occurrences etc which may lead to convergence issues. As we are restricting the population in terms of numbers then some of the variables have very few occurrences and we identified the variables to adjust on using a bigger population hence there may be convergence problems for only this particular model. This shows an alternative.                                                         |

These are separate models filtering on time group, adjusted for variables previously selected and strata(brcname). For those who died within 3 days of peak troponin and had invasive management these were assigned their original invasive variable as for those who did not die within 3 days of peak troponin.                                                                    |
